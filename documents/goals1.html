<b>Reflection 1</b>
<br><br>
Database Management System was the first class we took to learn about database development. In this class we revisited the basic concepts of database as well as learnt how to create relational databases, write SQL statements and queries to extract information to create and analyze tables. The above artifact is a snapshot of one of our normalization exercises. Database normalization is the process of restructuring a relational database in accordance with a sequence of normal forms. Normalization is in order to reduce redundancy of the data and also to improve data integrity. Normalization also involves organizing the columns or attributes and tables or relations of a database to ensure that their dependencies are properly enforced by database integrity constraints. The way to do proper normalization is done by applying formal rules by a process of creating new database design or by improving and existing database design. 
<br><br>In this class, we spent half of the semester in normalization, because it is very important to know how to normalize a database and make the database efficient. I personally took a while to understand and be able to normalize. There are 3 steps in normalization: we first normalize into the First Normal Form (1NF), then the Second Normal Form (2NF) and then the Third Normal Form (3NF). The first normal form can have columns in a table that can not hold more than one values. To get a table to be in second normal form, it must first be in first normal form and the non-prime columns can not be dependent on the proper subset of any candidate key of the table. A non-prime column or attribute is an attribute that is not a part of any candidate key. Finally, in the third step is built upon the first and second normal forms where all the column reference in referenced data which are not dependent on the primary key are removed. 
<br><br>If we do not normalize a database we come across three types of anomalies, the insertion, update and delete anomaly. An update anomaly is a data inconsistency that results from data redundancy and a partial update. An insertion anomaly occurs when certain attributes cannot be inserted into the database without the presence of other attributes. A deletion anomaly exists when certain attributes are lost because of the deletion of other attributes. In order to have an efficient and effective database, we should know how to properly normalize it. Therefore, I chose this artifact from this class instead of the ones that involved writing SQL statements and queries.
<br><br>After we were able to normalize the database, we then wrote SQL queries in Access. It was quick and easy to learn and work with SQL statements and this class helped a lot in making it easier for us for the next database class. I think this normalization assignment was one of my best works in class. I struggled with a lot of normalization assignments and eventually after a lot of practice, I was able to do it correctly in the first try. The knowledge of normalization helped me with relational databases in the long run and made me more interested in working with databases.

In programming 1, we learnt more about C# and encapsulation. We kept on working with console applications but also learnt about creating forms in this class. A windows form application is an application which is designed to run on a computer, not on a web browser. It has a collection of controls such as labels, textboxes, list boxes, buttons and so on. The controls have their own properties. For instance, the text property allows us to specify the caption in the title bar of the window. We also learnt about different methods to manipulate a form and increase user friendliness. For example, we can use the ShowDialog method to show a form as a dialog box. 
<br><br>We also learnt how to add events in controls. These events are things that would occur when an action is performed. For instance, if we add an event on the next button in a form, the code in the event would take us to the next item in the form. We can also use activated event to update the data when the forms are activated. Apart from these, we learnt that we can handle certain exceptions and display an error message in a message box and prompt the user on their error and what they can do about it. While creating forms, we should also take into consideration the spacing between textboxes, labels and buttons. We should also make sure that our tabbing are in the correct order and is user friendly. Tabbing comes in handy when a user prefers to navigate the form only through his keyboard. 
<br><br>Additionally, we can also restrict the type of information a user can put in a particular textbox. For instance, in my Midterm Password Project, I made sure that people could only enter string values in the first and last name text boxes. Apart from using the form class and the controls in a form, I also used string functions and methods in this project. I used methods such as substring method that retrieves a substring from this instance. I also used arrays to create and store a list of the names, id and social security numbers. The type of form I created for this project is non-interactive compared to our final project where we created multiple forms and displayed a splash screen while the forms were loading. However, I chose this project as it was very good start to practice creating forms and also a good practice to retain the basic string functions. 
<br><br>In this class, we learnt to use pre-programmed classes and one of the pre-programmed classes used in this project is the random class. The use of random class in this project was to generate random numbers for the student ID number. It made it very easy for us as the programmers to use this class instead of programming an extensive code to generate random numbers. When I look back at this project, I consider it to be an easy program. However, there are a few things that I would change. The exceptions were handled but I would use preventive methods to ensure that the user would enter the correct information and reduce cases where exceptions would be thrown. Overall, in my opinion, this project was a subtle representation of concepts we learnt in class.

The concept of MIS course was a very informative course. I took an 8-week course, so we covered a lot of topics in a short time span. This course focuses on human recourses, technology, marketing and methods for collecting information’s from the internal and external source and processing this information for facilitating the process of decision-making in the business. Management information system is an integrated set of component or entities that interact to achieve a particular function, objective or goal. It is a computer-based system that provides information for decisions making on planning, organizing and controlling the operation of the sub-system of the firm and provides a synergistic organization in the process.
<br><br>Modern management system relies on MIS, since the complexity of business management and the competitive nature of business requires handling of business operations with skill and foresight to advert the crisis. The management process is executed through a variety of decisions taken at each step of planning, organizing, staffing, directing, coordinating and controlling.
<br><br>The artifact I chose for this class is a six-panel program brochure. I chose this artifact because learning how make effective visuals is very important. It is said that we grasp more through visuals than regular texts. To stand out in the market, we need to make sure that our visuals stand out. We were given step-by-step procedure to create the brochure which made it very easy to do the brochure. I was able to brush up my skills of using different functions in MS Word. 
<br><br>Apart from learning how to make a proper brochure, we also learnt that with the development of new technologies, businesses and organizations are bound to face newer problems. Issues involved in the decision making of the organization can be influenced by the technology the business is using or plans to use. This class also helped us visualize a business from the manager of information system’s perspective. Decision making is a key role of the manage. It is also very important that the whole organization is trained on how to protect confidential information of the company. 
<br><br>Throughout the class, we also discussed about current business news and shared our perspectives on them. In this class, we also learnt about ethical issues and cases that have risen in the field of MIS. We also discussed about Kant’s Categorical Imperative and how it applies in the field of business and IT. Additionally, the discussion posts about current event and articles were very informative. It helped us understand how businesses and managers react when they deal with ethical issues. Overall, this class was very educational and helped us brush up our skills in Microsoft Office Suite.

We were introduced to the world of web designing through this class, the Web Design and Development. In this class, we learnt on the basic principles of designing and building websites. We focused on HTML and CSS in this class which are the common languages that most of the modern websites are built upon. HTML. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language which is the most basic building block of the web and it defines the meaning and structure of web content. HTML consists of a lot of important components and such as the tags or attributes we use (e.g.: head and body tags), character-based data types, character references and entity references. The tags are usually used in pairs but some tags such as the tag for line break can be used alone. The first tag in a pair is the start or opening tag, and the second is the end or closing tag. In this class we learned how to use the elements to define sections and help create a proper structure for the web page. 
<br><br>The formatting of a website is done by using the Cascading Style Sheet or CSS code language which is used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is used to separate and format the presentation of the contents of the website that includes fonts, colors and layouts. CSS helps the website not only look aesthetically pleasing but also improves the user’s accessibility to the content and provides more flexibility. The separation also helps to control presentation characteristics and enables more than one web page to share formatting when the relevant CSS code is linked in the main code of the page. This can also be done by creating a separate file with a CSS extension which helps in reducing complexity and the repetition of code. 
<br><br>Along with learning the very basics of HTML and CSS, we also learnt about classes and id to group elements and sort them according to their presentations. We also leant about Pseudo-classes that are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not contained in the document tree. We also learnt about how to make a website responsive to make it accessible in different media platforms. We used the “flexbox” to format the contents of the element according to the size of the screen they were being displayed on, which helped to make the website user friendly. The above artifact is the website I made from scratch and used almost all the concepts we learnt in this class. 
<br><br>If I had to change anything in the Website of Choice project, I would probably change my follow page and make it more interactive. I chose to do my website over Ed Sheeran as we had the option to it over anything that we preferred and would enjoy doing it. Without any doubt, this project was very fun to work on. Apart from this artifact, the website you are seeing right now is also one of the projects I started in this class. Throughout the creation of this project, I used the concepts I learnt in this class.

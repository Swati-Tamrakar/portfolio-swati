<b>Reflection 1</b>
<br><br>
The financial accounting class was an account-oriented study of the accounting cycle and was the first accounting class that I took. This class taught us about the aspect of accounting concerned with the summary, analysis and reporting of financial transactions pertaining to a business. We learnt how to make a simple general journal entry and prepare financial statements that will help stockholders, suppliers, employees, government agencies, business owners and other stakeholders to obtain information crucial for making important decisions for the business. We also learnt the standard guidelines to record, summarize and present transactions in a financial reports or financial statements. We learnt the basic accounting cycle, how to create an income statement and balance sheet as well. 
<br><br>One of the important things we learnt in this class was about payroll and the taxes involved in it. The four types of taxes involved are the FICA: social security, FICA: medicare, FUTA and SUTA. These were completely new terms to me and it took me a couple of assignments to be able to understand them fully. The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) is a United States federal payroll contribution directed towards both employees and employers to fund Social Security and Medicare federal programs that provide benefits for retirees, people with disabilities, and children of deceased workers. This is a mandatory payroll deduction and are withheld from an employee's wages as well as an employer's portion of the taxes that must be paid.
<br><br>FUTA stands for the Federal Unemployment Tax Act and is a payroll tax paid by employers on employee wages. There are certain exemptions made by the government for small businesses and family members employed by other family members in regard to FUTA. SUTA in the other hand is the State Unemployment Tax Act and a form of payroll tax that all states require employers to pay for their employees. SUTA is a counterpart to FUTA, the federal unemployment insurance program. The SUTA rates and wage base are different for each state.
<br><br>The other important aspect of financial accounting that I learnt was determining the costs of the ending inventory using the FIFO and LIFO techniques. The above artifact is one of the assignments I did where we had to find the cost of the ending inventory using both the techniques. FIFO and LIFO are cost layering methods that are used to value the cost of goods sold and ending inventory. FIFO stands for First In, First out and LIFO stands of Last In, First Out. In FIFO method, we assume that the goods added to the inventory are the first goods to me removed from the inventory for the sale and in the LIFO method, we assume that the goods added last to the inventory are the first goods to be removed for sale.  FIFO is usually opted by many businesses as a lot of the material in a business follow the FIFO flow which makes it a logical choice. There are some businesses that use the LIFO method. 
<br><br>During inflation, the businesses using LIFO would pay a smaller amount of income taxes as compared to the ones using FIFO method. During deflation, FIFO methods would amount to lesser income tax. In terms of record keeping, FIFO reduces the storage whereas LIFO would increase the record keeping. In general, LIFO is not recommended as it is not allowed under IFRS and the number of layers to track would be large. I personally like using the FIFO method as well. Overall, this class was not easy for me as accounting is not my forte, however, I learnt a lot of things that will help me in the future.

   <h1>Artifact 2-- Macroeconomics</h1>

<b>Reflection 2</b>
<br><br>
Macroeconomics is the part of economics that is concerned with the large-scale or the general economic factors such as national productivity. In this class we learnt about the determinants of employment, inflation, economic growth and analysis of international trade. In other words, macroeconomics is the branch of economics that studies how the aggregate economy behaves. There are five main objectives of macroeconomies that we covered in this class. They are: economic growth, price stability, full employment, income quality and economic equilibrium. 
<br><br>This class covered all the aspects of macroeconomics and we also discussed about the real-life applications and news regarding macroeconomics. The above artifact is the final paper I wrote for this class. We could choose any topic that we learnt about in this class and had to write a research paper on it. We wrote our research paper in sections of history and background, theories and finding, reflection and conclusion. I chose to write about corruption as it is still prevalent in a lot of countries and businesses. 
<br><br>Corruption is the misuse of resources or power for private gain. It is the abuse of entrusted power for private gain. Corruption comes in various forms such as bribery, fraud, nepotism and so on. One of the reasons behind choosing this topic was because my country also faces a big problem regarding corruption. In this paper, I compared the research of the corruption rate in the United States and in the world. 
<br><br>In my paper, I also put visuals and statistics of the corruption rates in both the United States and in the world. As we are better learners through visuals, I chose to include these in my paper for better understanding. Corruption is never a good thing and has many effects of it. No matter how strict the rules are or how strongly laws are enforced, people have found out loopholes in them and performed the act of corruption. Corruption has never been and will never be an easy battle to win. It is deeply rooted in our society, but we should always work towards getting rid of it. This paper was not just for us research about a topic but also look at it from a business personnel’s perspective. 
<br><br>While working on this paper, I realized that everything has a good side to it no matter how bad it is and corruption also has some advantages to it. However, I would never recommend using corruption as a key tool in managing a business or a country. I also figured out that the magnitude of the effects of corruptions depends on which part of the world we are in. For some people, corruption has become a way of living, nevertheless, we should always work towards fighting the temptation of being succumbed into corruption.

   <h1>Artifact 3-- Managerial Finance</h1>

<b>Reflection 3</b>
<br><br>
Managerial Finance is the first finance class I took, and this class taught us about corporate organizations, types of securities, short-term and long-term capitals, financial planning and control, forecasting and budgeting. Managerial Finance is the assessment of finance techniques to determine how they affect the business internally and externally. It takes into consideration how to improve financial techniques to better the company and where changes can be made to prevent loss. There are four main areas of financial topics and they are: corporate finance, investments, financial institutions, and international finance. 
<br><br>The goal of financial management in a for-profit business is to make decisions that increase the value of the stock, or, more generally, increase the market value of the equity. The corporate form of organization is superior to other forms when it comes to raising money and transferring ownership interests, but it has the significant disadvantage of double taxation. We also learnt that there is the possibility of conflicts between stockholders and management in a large corporation. 
<br><br>Managers of a financial entity must realize how resources are allocated within an organization. They need to know what each activity costs and why. These questions require managerial accounting techniques such as activity-based costing. Managers also need to anticipate future expenses and to get a better understanding of the accuracy of the budgeting process. Managerial finance also helps determine the best way to use money to improve future opportunities to earn money and minimize the impact of financial shocks. In this class we also learnt how to use the financial functions in Microsoft Excel. 
<br><br>The assignment I have chosen for this artifact calculates the NPV, IRR and MIRR to evaluate the financial benefits of two different projects. Net present value or NPV is the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows over a period of time. NPV is used in capital budgeting and investment planning to analyze the profitability of a projected investment or project. The internal rate of return (IRR) is a method of calculating rate of return. The term internal refers to the fact that the internal rate excludes external factors, such as inflation, the cost of capital, or various financial risks. It is also called the discounted cash flow rate of return. IRR is a very popular in estimating a project’s profitability, however, sometimes it can be misleading. 
<br><br>To avoid misleading information, there is another way to estimate a project’s profitability which is the MIRR (Modified Internal Rate of Return) method. I chose the above assignment as my artifact because not only did we use these methods to figure out which project would have the most outcome, we also used Excel functions to calculate the values.

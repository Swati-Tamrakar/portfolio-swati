<p><b>
 Hello and Namaste!<br> I am Swati Tamrakar, currently pursuing a degree in IT/MIS with a minor in Mathematics. I was born and raised in Kathmandu, the capital city of Nepal and came to the USA in 2015.<!-- I was initially just an IT major but I decided on becoming a math minor since IT and maths go hand in hand.
Similarly, I was always keen in learning about businesses and how they work and I was more than delighted to find out that I could do MIS and IT together. --><br>
I am a problem solver and have been tutoring Mathematics for the past 3 years. My students have regarded me as patient and perseverant. The experience as a tutor has humbled me as well as helped improve my communication skills. As an executive board member of the MultiCultural Leadership Organization and STEM Club, I have been able to enhance both my leadership and teamwork skills. 
Since technology changes constantly, it is important to be able to learn and adapt with it quickly. Being an avid learner, I am determined to put my best effort in all that I do.

<b>Reflection 1</b>
<br><br>
After the web design and development class, we took the PHP class. In this class we were taught on how to execute codes to the server and not to the client. PHP is a server-side scripting language and stands for Hypertext Preprocessor and uses an Apache server. PHP is different from other scripting languages such as JavaScript as those are client-side scripting language and requires application such as TomCat. Since PHP needs an Apache server, we must have the XAMPP, (Cross-Platform, Apache, MySQL, PHP and Perl), a free opensource webserver package that consists of Apache, MySQL, and interpreters for PHP and Perl. 
<br><br>We also use php to create a dynamic webpage. When a user sends a request for a dynamic webpage, the web server determines how to process it via the extension of the file. If the request is for a .php then the interpreter processes the request and uses the database server. When the interpreter is done processing the request it sends the web browser a HTML file which then sends the HTML file to the browser. The browser does not know if the file is static or dynamically obtained and displays it as a HTML file.
<br><br>In this class, we learnt the basics of php and we also learnt that the PHP script is a loosely typed language and can be placed anywhere in the document. We start the PHP script with a “<?php” tag and ends with “?>” tag. Similar to how HTML and C# has keywords, PHP also has some keywords, however, they are not case-sensitive. Unlike the keywords, the variable names in PHP are case sensitive.
<br><br>When we declare a variable name, we have to start with the dollar sign and we cannot have a number as the starting character in the variable’s name. For example, a variable name in PHP would look like $name. Like we put quotes around string values in C#, we do the same in PHP. PHP has three different scopes of variables: the local, global and static. Global variables are assigned outside a function and has a global scope which can be accessed only outside a function. If the variable is inside the function, it has a local scope and can be accessed only within the function. When a function is completed or executed, all the variables are deleted but sometimes we need a local variable to be available even after the function is executed. At such times we use static keyword to declare such variable.
<br><br>To create a dynamic text we use the “echo” statement in PHP. The echo statement is similar to that as a print statement as they are used to give the output, however, the ‘echo’ can hold multiple parameter without a return values whereas the ‘print’ can use only one argument with a return value of 1. The other content we learnt were similar to those in C# such as Booleans, strings, integers, floats, arrays and null values. The artifact I used for this class a basic application to calculate a person’s net salary. 
<br><br>I chose this project because apart from using html and css for the website, we used php to do the calculations. We also learnt that the two HTTP request methods, the post method and the get method. The get method requests data from a specified resource whereas the post method submits data to be processed to a specified resource. We used the post method in this project since we are asking for the user’s credentials to calculate their net salary and display it on another page. Additionally, we also learnt how to handle special characters and prevent dangerous injections during a user input which are vulnerable to hackers with malicious intent

The artifact for programming two is an example of object-oriented programming. It was a project where we kept track of the two different types of customers, the wholesale customers and the retail customers. What I learnt in this class was Lists, and how to use List<T>. List<T> Class Represents a strongly typed list of objects that can be accessed by an index or foreach loop and it stores values of specific types without the need to for the types to be casted to or from the object. It also provides methods to search, sort, and manipulate lists. Lists are flexible compared to arrays. They are dynamic which means that they can shrink and grow as needed. 
<br><br>Lists are very convenient to use when we do not know how much storage to accumulate for it. There are important properties and methods using lists such as add, insert, count, and remove. We typically use a foreach loop to iterate the list and for the Customer Maintenance project, we used foreach loop for iteration and the reason behind choose List<T> was because of its dynamic nature since it is ideal for storing and retrieving large number of elements.

<br><br>Dynamic link library, also known as DLL is another topic we learnt in this class. DLLs provides a mechanism for shared data and codes that helps in sharing important or necessary codes without requiring applications to be linked or recompiled. In this class, we also learnt how to link our databases with our programs. Apart from learning about List<T>, DLL and linking databases, we also learnt more about object-oriented programming. Object oriented programming consists of abstraction: which is taking a  concept and treating it as an object, encapsulation: which is used to hide the values or the state of a structured data object in a class by only allowing access to authorized personell, polymorphism: which is used to subtype a class and inheritance: which allows a new (child, sub or derived)class to derive from an existing (parent, base or super) class.  
<br><br>Until programming 2, we only used existing exceptions. In this class, we were taught how to create and handle exceptions. Exceptions can be handled by using parse which is converting to a type of variable, call stack, which is using try, catch and finally statements, or exception propagation. Try-catch statements were taught in programming 1 but in this class, we were introduced to the finally statement. In a try block we write our normal program, catch is where we deal with the exception and finally is where the codes are executed regardless of exceptions. 
<br><br>When users define their own exception classes it is created as Application Exception class also known as exception propagation. At the end, we also learnt XML, which is eXtensible Markup Language. XML is a markup language much like HTML and is designed to store and transport data. We used XMLReader Class to read XML as it lets us run through the XML content, one element at a time. Another class called XMLDocument class also exists that reads the entire XML content into memory and then lets us navigate as we want. However, XMLReader is commonly used as it is more efficient and faster.

<b>Reflection 3</b>
<br><br>
The Database Processing and Management Class was the second database class we took after the Database Management Systems. In this class we learnt about database models, how to control concurrency, transactions, security of the database system, recovery and so on. The structure of the relationships in most databases follow either the hierarchical, network or relational models. A hierarchical database model is one in which the data are organized in a top-down or inverted tree-like structure. This type is best suited for situations where the logical relationships between the data can be properly represented with the one-parent-many-children approach. A network model is an extension of the hierarchical database model where there is an owner-member relationship in which a member may have many owners, in contrast to a one-to-many-relationship. A relational model describes data using a standard tabular format where all data elements are placed in two-dimensional tables called relations, which are the equivalent of files.
<br><br>While building and working with databases, we have to ensure that one user’s activity does not impact the others. Since databases can be accessed by more than one user at a time, it is very important for us to use concurrency controls. To avoid concurrency issues, we can use resource locking that disallows transactions from reading, modifying and writing to a data which is locked. We can choose different locking mechanisms (implicit locking, explicit locking, shared locking, etc.) to lock our database. However, we are vulnerable to face a deadlock issue where two transactions or activities end up waiting on each other to release their resources. 
<br><br>Transactions consists of series of stems and it is important for each step to be successful in order for that transaction to be saved. There are different types of transactions. An atomic transaction is where all of the database actions occur or none of them do. This helps to ensure that the transaction completes everything it needs to do before saving the changes. The next type is a consistent transaction where no other transaction is permitted until the current is finished. This is helpful as it ensures that the transaction integrity has statement level consistency among all the records. The next type is a durable transaction where all committed changes are permanent. 
<br><br>The other important thing we learned in this class is database security. We have to make sure that only authorized users can have access to a specified database. Authorization assigns the authenticated users specific right to do specific activities on the system and makes sure that the user has the basic right to use the system in the first place. Another important concept is data recovery. There are two ways to recover data, one via reprocessing where the system goes back to the known point and reprocesses the workload from there, and the other through the rollback/rollforward which is done by periodically making copy of the database and keeping the log of the changes made by transaction against the database since save. When failure occurs one of the two method can be used. Rollforward method restores the saved data and all valid transaction since the save are reapplied. Rollbackward method corrects mistakes by undoing the changes they made in the database, then the valid transactions that were in the process at the time of failure are restarted.
<br><br>The above artifact is of an assignment where we used triggers. A trigger is a stored procedure that is automatically invoked by the DBMS when a specific activity takes place. Triggers can be defined over DML or DDL statement. DDL trigger can record every instance of a Create, Alter or Drop statement that is executed. DML trigger can be used to enforce referential integrity but it is not preferred. DML triggers are used to enforce business rules and to monitor modification to database table. In SQL, triggers can have definition to include multiple event types such as Before, Insert and Delete. I also chose this specific assignment because we use cursors which is a set of rows together with a pointer that identifies a current row.

<b>Reflection 4</b>
<br><br>
The advance programming class was the final class we took in learning C# coding language. In this class we learnt about Asynchronous Programming and created WPF applications. Asynchronous Programming or Async Programming is a type of programming where a part of works runs separately from the main application and notifies the main application about its progress whether it has been completed or failed. This type of programming is very useful because it gives the platform for an application to improve and is more responsive. We used a background worker class to execute an operation on a separate thread.
<br><br>WPF stands for Windows Presentation Foundation. It is a Graphic User Interface (GUI) used along with the .Net Framework. A GUI Framework allows us to create a windows application with a range of elements such as labels, buttons, textboxes and so on. We incorporated the use of background workers that allows us to start, update and cancel an asynchronous operation. We also learnt about data centric applications and data binding in this class. We used XAML to create our WPF applications as it has a greater binding capability and also provides hardware acceleration. XAML stands for eXtensible Application Markup Language. It is a newer language and it also splits the GUI and the code behind the application into several entities, making the application efficient. We learnt how to create single-object binding and binding into XAML declared instances. 
<br><br>We also learnt about ADO.net (ActivexDataObjects.Net) which provides the classes to develop database applications in the .Net framework. The ADO.net uses a disconnected data architecture and the concurrency issues are not handled by the database management system. The artifact that I chose for this class is the T-shirt stock application that was our final project for this class. We used the MVVM pattern that is used in WPF applications to create this application. MVVM stands for Model-View-ViewModel, which facilitates a separation of development of the GUI from the business logic. The view model is in charge of exposing the data objects from the model in a way that the objects are easily managed and presented. It is also considered as the blue between the view and the model. MVVM is basically a separation between logic and the view code. It also leverages data binding. 
<br><br>I chose this particular project as my artifact because we spent about a month to finish it. We were working on it as we were learning about it in class. I considered this to be effective as I was learning by doing. Apart from using the MVVM model, we also used the background workers class, connected a database with our application and used XAML to create our windows forms. This class was a fairly difficult class. However, we learnt a lot of new concepts in this class. While doing this project, there were times when I got frustrated because I couldn’t find the solution to some errors even while debugging. We worked on a in class project similar to this serving as a base for this project, however, at times, it was hard to figure out why the code wasn’t working. If I were to change anything in this project, I would make a list of what needs to be done, sequence the list and then start coding and designing the form accordingly.

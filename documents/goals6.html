<b>Reflection 1</b>
<br><br>
Communication is one of the key soft skills that everyone needs. It is very important to be able to communicate properly and get our message across. The Business Communication class I took was very helpful for me as it helped me understand how formal communications take place in the business world. The main focus of this class was helping us understand what soft skills are how to instill those skills in ourselves to help us. We also learnt about professionalism and how to communicate properly in a business environment. While working as a business professional, we need to know how to do effective business research and be able to write proper business documentations as well as deliver effective presentations. 
<br><br>Another purpose of this class is to teach the student about planning and managing a business project and communications strategy. We also learnt about advanced interpersonal communication, business etiquette and relationship building skills. Communicating effectively across cultures and to a range of different business audiences such as managers, clients, customers, colleagues is very important. Additionally, understanding how to utilize constructive negotiation and conflict management skills and being ethical in all communication styles was taught in this class.
<br><br>One of the things I learnt in this class is to be able to write point papers and deliver them in the most effective way without consuming a lot of time. Every week we had to write a point paper which is basically a summary of an article but in bullet format and present it in the class. We had to make sure that all the main points we covered in the summary. The purpose of the point paper was to help us limit our reports into a page length and not more. The less we wrote, the better it was. Point papers helps get the message across with minimum but effective sentences and if the paper sparks an interest with a reader, the link to the article was attached in the report. I considered this to be very effective for me as I tend to write long summaries. It helped me pick out the most important points from an article and exclude the rest. We were also taught on how to write formal business letters and were taught the concept of Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF) technique while writing them. 
<br><br>We had to prepare an elevator speech and deliver it in class as well. An elevator pitch is a short description of an idea, product or company that explains the concept in a way such that any listener can understand it in a short period of time. In the elevator pitch we delivered, we had to talk about ourselves for 45 – 60 seconds. Talking about oneself is hard and having a time limit is even harder. We had to make sure we talked about our best qualities without rushing in that time period. Personally, this was one of the hardest assignments, but I learnt a lot about myself during the process of writing out my main qualities. The description in my <a href = "about.html" target = "_blank">about page</a> is my elevator pitch. 
<br><br>The above artifact is a presentation me and my classmate presented. Our final task for this class was to present on a business idea, business product or a service. We chose to do it on reusable straws as both of us care about the environment deeply. We tried to incorporate enough visuals and effective statistics to promote the use of reusable straws. We introduced the idea of using a bamboo straw and why it is a better alternative than other reusable straws. We even purchased a few bamboo straws and passed it around so that our audience could have a better look into it. I felt that this presentation gave us a feel of the real business world. We had to promote our product in the best way possible by researching on the target market and business values. Overall, this class was very effective in making us understand how communication works and how it is very important to be able to communicate well in the real world, not just in the business world.

<b>Reflection 2</b>
<br><br>
Principles of Marketing class introduced me into the world of marketing. This class focused on the marketing process and examines the range of marketing decisions that an organization must make in order to sell its products and services. It teaches us that the focus of marketing has always been on the consumer. Marketing is an understanding of how to communicate with the consumer and is characterized by four activities: creating products and services that serve consumers, communicating a clear value proposition, delivering products and services in a way that optimizes value, and exchanging value for those offerings. 
<br><br>Marketing is often mixed with advertising but in reality, advertising is just one way of marketing.  Advertising is a process where firms and companies determine on which products to offer, how to price those products, and whom their target market are. In this class, we were also taught to question ourselves when learning about how to market for a product. One of the things I liked in this class was the applications of marketing. Each student had to present two applications of marketing that is currently taking place. Some of the students presented about Superbowl ads whereas some talked about sports merchandise. 
<br><br>I chose to do my first application on the advertisement of Samsung phones where the advertisement showed the differences between Samsung phones and iPhones. It is very important for a company to know their competitors and it is very risky for a company to advertise their products by comparing themselves to their rivals. However, this specific ad was designed very carefully and smartly where they were comparing themselves as well as showed why their product was better. 
<br><br>Another application I did was the Heinz Mayochup poll where the company, Heinz, created a Twitter poll where people were asked if they would like a fusion sauce of mayonnaise and ketchup. I found this marketing tactic to be well thought of. This is the age of social media and Heinz used it to leverage their decision making in introducing a new product. All they had to do was create a poll where people from anywhere could choose if they wanted the fusion sauce or not without spending a dollar of their marketing budget.
<br><br>Social media was one of the marketing tools we learnt in class. Social media is highly used by everyone across the globe. In class, we worked in groups focusing on one of the many major social media platforms and the advantages it provided as a marketing tool. We chose to work on YouTube and found that it was an excellent platform for both small and big business to market to wide variety of audience. We realized that YouTube was not only a great promotional tool, but businesses are able to use their videos to create trust, authority and recognition by creating a personalized channel. 
<br><br>As we worked on this project, we realized that YouTube was much more than a platform to post videos, rather it was a tool that helps businesses reach a wide range of their customers with the ability to choose what market they want to target. Overall, this class was very interesting to me as we had real life applications embedded into our chapters that made understanding marketing much easier.

<b>Reflection 3</b>
<br><br>
The Principles of Management class was the first management class that I took. In this class, we learnt about the importance of the role of managers and the role of effective management. The first most important role of a manager is the use of resources. The use of resources must be done effectively and efficiently. Managers are responsible with planning, organizing, controlling and leading the resources of the company. Whether it be human resources or non-living resources, it is the task of the manager to make the most out of the given resources to achieve the company’s mission.
<br><br>A company’s mission is the goal that the company has set out for itself and everyday the company works towards fulfilling that goal. A successful company is the result of a good management. To be considered as a successful company is a compliment to the managers. In this class, we also learnt about the various skills a manager should possess in order to lead the company or their team. A manager needs to have both the soft skills and hard skills, but the soft skills take precedence over the hard skills. One of the soft skills that is very important is the interpersonal skills. Interpersonal skills include having emotional intelligence, communication, reliability, leadership, negotiation, empathy and so on. One of the key things to be able to have a successful management is communication.
<br><br>Communication is the key. Whether it be in personal or professional life, communication is very important to keep the trust alive and to avoid misjudgment. The other important skill we learnt in this class is leadership is the process of influencing the activities of an individual or a group towards achieving a goal. Not everyone is born a leader, but everyone can learn how to become one. Leadership deals with the people aspect of the company and involves skills like inspiring, motivating, directing, and so on. Management and leadership go hand in hand. 
<br><br>The above artifact is a presentation I did on the company called Johnson and Johnson. Each of us had to do a presentation on any company of our choice and research on their company mission, their business structure and their social impact. I chose Johnson and Johnson because I have been using their products since I was little. 
<br><br>I thoroughly enjoyed preparing and performing this presentation. The research made me aware that in order to be considered as one of the successful companies, the foundation of the management and the business should be very strong. Apart from that, the company’s impact on the society and the environment is very important to retain their consumers and their stakeholders. While doing this research, I also found out about the decentralized operating model of the company as well as the strategic framework of their company which has made them stand out amongst others. Overall, this class was very informative and gave me a visualization of what a career path in management would look like.

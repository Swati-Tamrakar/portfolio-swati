<b>Reflection 1</b>
<br><br>
The Business Ethics course I took in Fall 2017 has been a very educative and informative class for me. Not only did I learn about business ethics, I also learnt about many ethical issues that business face and how they tackle it. In this class, we learnt about the role of ethics in business and in daily life. The course taught about the responsibilities that a manager and the board of directors have not only towards the business and the employees but also to other stakeholders such as government, society and environment.
<br><br>In one of my case studies, I wrote about Galleon Group and the Insider Trading that took place in the company. Insider trading was a new vocabulary for me, rather I was used to the term bribery. After researching and studying this case, I was surprised on how people could have such selfish motives. I learnt about how one small action could lead to very big consequences. One of the interesting things I learnt by doing this case was how people in higher position in the company were able to hide their mistakes and not be questioned. It made me ponder about whether all businesses deal with these issues or not. Another interesting aspect was how, companies like these had good code of conduct and made sure that the company was transparent but was dealing with insider trading at the same time.
<br><br>Issues like this, made me wonder whether companies are being faithful to its stockholder and shareholders. It is unfair for both the primary and secondary shareholders that they are being deceived and if any consequences, they are obliged to pay the price as well. Insider trading and bribery are not new terms in the business world, and hence, every company should take prevention. I believe that this case paper of mine portrayed my knowledge about the case and how we should go about with being ethical in business environments. This case study helped me understand that even if a company has been able to maintain an ethical standing, there are times when they make choices that lead to adverse consequences. It is also very important for
a company to be transparent and correct any mistakes that might have occurred in the process of ethical decision making. 
<br><br>This project has helped me in improving my critical thinking process and analyze the ethical issues in a business process. If I were to review this case study, I would dig deeper into the case and get information from other research materials apart from the book. Overall, this class helped in making us understand what the ethical aspect of business looks like. No matter how careful we are, there exists loopholes that are easy to fall into. From this class, I also learnt that we should be able to accept our mistakes and always have room for improvements.

<b>Reflection 2</b>
<br><br>Apart from doing case studies and learning about ethical cases in the book, we also did some research on ethical cases not mentioned in the book. In this class, each one of us had to do a 10-15 minutes presentation about any company. The objective of this project was for us to look a certain issue of our choice, do our research and present it in the class. I chose Intel as the company of my choice because it has been awarded as the Top 100 Ethical Company for the 5<sup>th</sup> time in a row and also because I use Intel products every day.
<br><br>In this presentation we had to research about our company of choice and find out if they had any ethical issues or not. While doing research on Intel, I was curious on why and how intel was considered ethical. I researched about Ethisphere, the committee decides which companies would come under the Top 100 Ethical companies.  Intel is known for its corporate governance and code of conduct. However, intel did have some big ethical issues which made me rethink on why they were still considered ethical. Intel dealt with their antitrust lawsuit which lasted for about a decade. The company made decisions that had unethical consequences for which they compensate with huge amount of money. I
<br><br>Additionally, Intel also dealt with the case of conflict minerals that were being used in making their microprocessors. They were not aware about the conflict materials until the issue came up and hence, they did not step back to change their raw materials into other minerals. Intel had other minor issues, but they were always quick with finding solutions and implementing them.After doing this presentation, I understood the concept of being ethical. Having good code of conduct and corporate governance isn't the only thing that determines whether the business is ethical but how the company tackles its ethical issues is also taken into consideration. 
<br><br>Doing our own research has helped me know more about businesses in the real world and this class has also increased my understanding on how to approach with ethical issues. It also made me understand that regardless of how careful a business might be in staying ethical, there exists loopholes where the business could potentially do something unethical. Mistakes happen all the time but if there exists a mistake in an organization or business, they should accept it, corrects it and try to improve. If I were to review this presentation again, I would research more into the business structure of intel and how they perform their social responsibility. Overall, this class gave us an idea of what we should expect in the real-world regarding ethics and how we should always aim to be ethical in our workplace.

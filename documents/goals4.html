<b>Reflection 1</b>
<br><br>
The concept of computer hardware class was an online class with video lectures, demonstration videos, fact sheets, stimulated labs and practice quizzes. This class taught us all the aspects of the physical components of a computer hardware system. Computer hardware is the collection of physical parts of a computer system. This includes the computer case, monitor, keyboard, and mouse. It also includes all the parts inside the computer case, such as the hard disk drive, motherboard, video card, and many others. Computer hardware is what you can physically touch. In this class, we learnt how computer hardware and the operating systems work together. This class was very informative as it explained what it would be like if we had the job of a computer technician. 
<br><br>The course focused on components in a computer system such as storage, motherboards, processors and memory. We learnt how to connect the hardware components with each other and also how to manage computer storage. Ensuring the safety of the data and information stored in a computer is very important and we learnt about various devices where we can store information securely. Being able to build a computer is important but it is also important to know how to troubleshoot common computer programs. We also learnt on how to manage a windows and mac desktop systems, how to implement a computer system from both the hardware and software perspective and how to manage files in the file system. 
<br><br>The course also looks at how to secure desktop systems and emphasizes on the security by teaching us how to make sure that the right people are able to access the right information on that desktop system. I chose to use the artifact where I built a computer from scratch. I think that before we move on in depth with computer hardware and their implementations with the computer software, we should first know the components of the hardware and be able to build it. This artifact sums up what all we should know in order to set up a computer. 
<br><br>While doing this stimulation lab, it took me couple of tries before I could do it in one session. It is easy to miss minor connections in this set up. Additionally, it is even harder to debug where we went wrong because we only know that we have an error at the very end when we boot the computer. I kept on missing a few things here and there which eventually made me frustrated. However, I overcame my frustration by writing down the step by step procedure and following the steps so that I do not miss anything. Overall, most of the stimulation lab assignments needed a couple of tries before we were able to do it in one try. In my opinion, doing the labs multiple times helped me retain the information learnt in each section. The only thing I would want to change in this class is to have a hands-on experience with computer hardware.

Concept of Computer Networks class taught us the different aspects of computer networking system. We took this class only after taking the concepts of hardware class. Similar to the hardware class, this class was also an online class with video lectures, demonstration videos, fact sheets, stimulated labs and practice quizzes.  The data network consists of nodes, which refers to any computer or digital device using the network and links, the physical connections (either wired or wireless) that carry messages between nodes. The data networks are important to all organizations as they provide faster, easier access to any message or data that can be represented and stored in digital format. When an employee researches an issue relevant to the organization and share the data with others in a data format the computer recognizes, they can copy key information from the report into their own, saving significant amounts of time.
<br><br>This class also taught us how to identify network cables, connector types, and the different networking standards common in a computer network today. We also learnt how to select and install the appropriate network interface cards for a particular network along with managing static and dynamic IP addressing and network protocols. The more advanced concepts that were taught in this class consisted of identifying wired and wireless network components and setting up a wired or wireless network. We learned how to configure network security, manage network traffic, and configure remote access to a network and most importantly we learned to troubleshoot common network issues.
<br><br>The above artifact is a stimulated lab where we were configuring a DMZ.  A demilitarized zone (DMZ) is a buffer network or subnet that sits between the private network and an untrusted network such as the internet. We create a DMZ by configuring two firewall devices, one connected to the public network and the other one connected to the private network. We then configure a single device with three network cards, one connected to the public network, one connected to the private network, and one connected to the screened subnet. After that we configure the ARP so that the public interface of the firewall device responds to ARP requests for the public IP address of the device. In this particular lab, we configured the DMZ server to obtain the IP address and DNS address automatically and then we verified that the server receives the reserved IP address. 
<br><br>Similar to the Concepts of Hardware class, this class consisted of us doing numerous stimulation labs. Comparatively, I felt that the stimulation lab exercises for this class were easier than that of hardware. However, since there were a lot of chapters and concepts to cover, there were times when I felt like I could not give enough attention to one or more concepts. Overall, this class was very informative and helped me understand better about computer networks.
